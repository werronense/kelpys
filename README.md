This repo is a demo project I made to show how to do form validation with React Hook Form and Zod.

It uses Zod v4. To learn more about schemas and data validation with Zod, check out [Zod's documentation](https://zod.dev/).

I also used shadcn/ui components to build the forms. The shadcn docs include a [great tutorial](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form) on how to use React Hook Form, shadcn, and Zod.
